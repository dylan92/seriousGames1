Install HappyFunTimes: http://superhappyfuntimes.net/install

Open HappyFunTimes and the Unity executable together. HappyFunTimes will launch a command line shell that you cannot interact with. The command line shell will tell you what IP address you're connected to and what ports it's listening for. Type the IP number, followed by a colon and the port number, into the address bar of a browser on a touchscreen device or computer. For example, Drexel often connects me to 144.118.100.185:18679.
