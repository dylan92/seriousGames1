Game project for Serious Games

Right now, the game does NOT have an executable file. The HappyFunTimes system goes through some weird initialization things and can't seem to push out its own build. However, it will still run within Unity.

In order to play HFT games, you need to install a few systems. Follow these steps to go through basic setup: https://github.com/greggman/HappyFunTimes/blob/master/docs/makinggames.md#setting-up-for-development

Once all of the different programs are installed, open the Main.unity scene with Unity. Then, open the HappyFunTimes program. It will launch a command line shell that you cannot interact with. If you added the Unity project with the hft add command using Node.js properly, the HappyFunTimes command line shell will tell you what IP address you're connected to and what ports it's listening for. Run the Unity game in the scene. Any onlookers can join the game by typing in the IP address followed by a colon and a port. For example, the dragonfly3 network often tells me to connect to 129.25.142.54:18679.
